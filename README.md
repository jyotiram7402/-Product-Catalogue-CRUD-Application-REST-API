# -Product-Catalogue-CRUD-Application-REST-API
This project implements a RESTful API for managing a structured product catalogue system. The API is developed using Java and integrated with a database, preferably MongoDB, to handle the storage of nested product data. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on products and search for products based on various filters.
